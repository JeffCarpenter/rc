~From: Randy <72246.172@CompuServe.COM>

     A friend called me on the phone and read me your message
about the Dvorak keyboard.  I don't (yet!) have direct internet
access, so I'm sending you this via my Compuserve mailbox.

     There are indeed many people using the Dvorak.  *Briefly*,
the Dvorak was designed via ergonomic proceedures to be easy to
learn and use for "touch" (10-finger) typing.  "Qwerty" was
designed in the 1870s to overcome the mechanical limitations of
early typewriters (specifically, the first Remington model).
Touch typing was thought of long after these "modern" typewriters
came on the market.  Dvorak typists tend to be much faster, both
because of ease of typing (70% of keying is on the home row, vs
32% on Qwerty) and because of the reduced error rate on Dvorak
due to its ergonomics, but the ease in learning and typing is its
greatest advantage.

     A number of products are available to help learn the Dvorak
layout.  Both "Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing" and "Typing Tutor"
come with Dvorak lessons, for instance.

     The primary source of Dvorak information is Freelance
Communications.  Among other products, they carry my book, The
Dvorak Keyboard, which will help to get you started (the only
book on the subject; 96 pp trade softcover; $12.95+ship).  A
packet of information (including the book) is available for US$12
postpaid to north America from Freelance Communications, PO Box
1895, Upland CA 91785 USA.  Fax: 818 791-0405.  If you send me
your fax number, they will fax you a sheet of ordering
information.

Way back in my typing carrer I remapped my keyboard and used the 'Typing
Tutor' program that IBM used to sell for almost nothing.  This was when
I bought my first computer in '82 or so.

I was able to get speed equal to a normal keyboard in fairly short order,
but that is not saying much, as I didn't not type well on either keyboard
at the time.  This even tho the early excercises concentrated on words 
easy on the normal keyboard.  That is the letters a, s, d, f, j, k, l.

I gave it up when I realized that:

	*	I probably could not as fast on two keyboards as I could on either
		one, even if the one was poorly designed.

	*	I probably could not ensure availability of dvorak.  What if I
		had to sit at a coworkers station for a few minutes to demonstrate
		something?  What if I had to used a mechanical typewriter or other
		non remappable keyboard?

So go for it, but realize that it may not save you any time or frustration
in the end.  It is to bad, sometimes, that these standards can get so
much momentum.

Where did you get this program?  I tried to learn the keyboard a while
back but had to stop because I couldn't use it on Unix.  My technique
for learning was simple.  Just type all my papers, letters, etc.  Type
a few pages a day.  The only problem is that once you start, you will
probably not type as fast in QWERTY for a while.  It took me about
a year to undo four months of Dvorak.

Good luck!

Dear David,
   I recently converted a keyboard to a Dvorak layout but have not as yet got around to using Mavis for the practice to achive touch typing confidence.

   Simply popping the keys out and swapping them around works only on a few boards (HoneyWells?) as most have different profiles for different rows - the home row etc.  Presumably yours didn't or you are using the alternative of stickers?  The former has one draw back - {} [] are located on different keys on a qwerty board whereas the dvorak accesses them by a shift on the same key.  I think the dvorak wins for speed (on that combination anyway).

   Dispite many attempts in the past, especially in the '60s, by some very powerful players it is most unlike qwerty boards will ever be replaced.  Therefore you must realize that using your board will be for ease at home.  The only other alternative is to become so proficient that you are able to use a board without looking (at all!) and import your driver (or carry a disk with it on around).

   Problems I have noticed: the layout in WinMavis didn't seem to change on screen in the version I saw but did on the original?  If you are using a PC the driver that comes in the Dos 6 Supplementary disk is ignored by Windows.  Microsoft have done it again...
  
   Could you please tell me which driver you are using and where you obtained it from?  Do you know of any others? 



Regards,

James Stoney.

Despite all the research on the ease of learning DVORAK and the
efficient use of the system, it is my opinion that because the
majority of the population would have to re-learn a new system
and because of the future impact of voice technology, most
persons do not want to bother with a new system at this time.
Also, even though many keyboards can be switched to either
DVORAK or QWERTY by the computer system or by software, there
is no guarantee that DVORAK will be available in every
available worksite.  For these reasons, I have not agressively
sought a change to DVORAK in keyboarding instruction in VA
public schools (we are having a hard enough time convincing
earlier grade levels that a touch system of keyboarding is
necessary for effective interaction with a keyboard, especially
in writing).

Recently, one of our business teachers in Frederick Co., Linda
Wilson of James Wood High School, 161 Apple Pie Ridge Rd.,
Winchester, VA 22603 (Phone 703/667-5226), asked for
information for instructional materials for DVORAK.  I
referred her to our Virginia Vocational Curriculum and Resource
Center to conduct a computer search for information.  I have
not heard of Linda's results, but you may want to contact her.
I do not know whether she has a va.pen/internet account.

The only other suggestion I have is to contact major keboarding
publishers such as Southwestern Publishing Co. and Glencoe,
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, and others. 

I would be interested in your findings.

	Hi, I was wondering what kind of program is it? Where can I get a copy
of it? Also does the program come with a doc that tells you the layout of the
keyboard? I've heard about this type of keyboard, and it's adventages. You see
on a regular keyboard, the most common keys are located on the left hand. In
this new keyboard layout, the most common keys will be on the right hand. ALso
the distrubtion of keys will be equal on both hands when you are typing.

I have been using a Dvorak keyboard for about 2 years now.  I used to
touch-type on a QWERTY, and the first few days after I switched were
far more disoriented than I had imagined they would be.  The next few
weeks were incredibly frustrating.  I would say it was 8-10 months
before I could equal the speed I used to get with a QWERTY keyboard,
but its hard to say for sure because I never really measured either
one.

Now that I have gotten really familiar with the Dvorak keyboard, I
really like it.  It even serves as an interesting security device for
times when one of my officemates tries to type something when I'm
logged in :-)  I did not have a book to learn from - I just started
typing and learned by practice, assuming the basic "home positions"
and ideas about which fingers should hit which keys are independent of
the mapping from keys to letters.

Unfortunately, as I type as much C code as text, I don't get nearly as
much of a speedup as one might hope for, as the numbers and symbols
are hard to get at on either keyboard.

I just made a small printout of the layout and taped it to the
bottom edge of my monitor.  It worked fine an finally cured me of
looking at the keyboard since looking there din't help!

>Does anybody actually use a dvorak - I'd appreciate any comments you

I've been using it for about 10 years and have no desire to give
it up.  :)   I'm not particulary quick with my fingers so even
with dvorak, my typing speed is short of amazing.  The critical
factor is that I find it *much* quicker and *much* less tiring to
type dvorak.  

Spend a couple weeks learning and you will never want to go back.
Thanks to computers, the occasions that you do are rare.  Even on
a dumb terminal you can have dvorak if you use GNU emacs!

Many people feel that if they learn dvorak, they will forget
qwerty.  I have not found that to be true and switching back and
forth does not cause too much greif.  I often have to jump
between a computer and typewriter and have not had problems.
I've talked with others who have the same experience.

Happy typing!

Dave,

   I also have been very interested in this prospect. I'm able to type
between 60-70 words a minute now, but I understand that I could conceivably
TRIPLE that by using a Dv keyboard. 

   Would you be interested in starting a communication with me to form kind
of a "support" group for learning it? We could encourage each other and
exchange information about Dving. Anyways. Would you know of a good keyboard
that would be available for the IBM (Dv, of course). 

   Good luck one way or the other though!

I use the dvorak keyboard, although I have not gained as much speed
with it as the american standard. I think that the dvorak keyboard is
worth learning. However, you must have patience.

Below are two xmodmap files which convert dvorak to qwerty and back
again. The xdvorak program never worked for me, so I use these
instead.

Good luck!

I've been using a Dvorak-like layout for about 11 years now.
The speed increase is real but negligible (5% to 10%).  The
more important advantage (IMHO) is the lower likelihood of
wrist nerve damage and carpal tunnel syndrome.  Here in SunPro,
several people in my building alone have gotten CTS or its
precursors or related problems since SPARCstations, with their
awful keyboard layout, became prevalent.  I think that my use
of the Dvorak-like layout has been part of the reason that I
have so far escaped this problem, and it is despite the fact that
I've been putting in lots of long hours for about the past year.

I didn't use anything to teach me it -- I just tried things, and
typed sorta slowly for about a month.

Yes, Typing Tutor IV is programmed to use the Dvorak keyboard - that is,
teach the home row first, then the farther letters.  It's how I learned.

My only comment is that you're in trouble when you have to do a lot of
typing on other machines.  I learned Dvorak keyboard 5 years ago, before
I knew I'd have to type a lot at work.  My own desk computer is a PC, so
I can handle that, but the main computers shared with others is a
mainframe, with no Dvorak capability.  Likewise with the occasions I have
to use a typewriter.

Still, I now type 55 wpm, whereas with the QWERTY layout, the max I ever
did was 13!

~From: gasior@ltpsun.gsfc.nasa.gov (Eric Gasior)

I been using a Dvorak keyboard on my Mac for a couple of months. The
biggest problem I have is that my typing speed hasn't recovered, but that's
partly because the key caps are still for a standard keyboard.

It is more comfortable than a qwerty keyboard - my fingers and wrists move
less. Adapting to the new punctuation positions is wierd. The only serious
complaint that I have with the design is that the "f" key should be easier
to reach.
