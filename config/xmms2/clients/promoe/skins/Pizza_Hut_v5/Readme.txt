UPDATE

v 2.1
Kevin Lassley kindly revised the volume graphic, achieving the effect I'd intended from the outset.  Smooth, and great work.


v 2.0
I'm correcting two long-standing absences with this update.

First, the skin never had a skinned AVS window.

Second, it never had a readme file!
