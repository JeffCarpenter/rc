  ;; Next time you start Gnus, you get a menu called ¨Mailcrypt¨ which
  ;; gives you an easy access to GnuPG.

  ;; Some variable settings which might be helpful are:

  ;; Use the pgp2 compatibility wrapper
  (setq mc-gpg-path "/usr/bin/gpg-compat")

  ;; If you have more than one key, specify the one to use
  (setq mc-gpg-user-id "0x12345678")

  ;; Always sign encrypted messages
  (setq mc-pgp-always-sign t)

  ;; How long should mailcrypt remember your passphrase
  (setq mc-passwd-timeout 600)

  ;; To sign automatically every message you send, you need to add some
  ;; lisp code. After adding the following lines to your .emacs file,
  ;; (X)Emacs will ask you if the message is to be signed before sending
  ;; it.

  ;; (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'my-sign-message)
  (defun my-sign-message ()
    (if (yes-or-no-p "Sign message? ")
