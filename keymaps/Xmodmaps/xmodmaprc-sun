! Turn Alt Graph into Control
clear mod2
keysym Mode_switch = Control_R
add control = Control_R

! Turn Compose into Alt
keysym Multi_key = Alt_R
add mod4 = Alt_R

! Rename the Home, End, PgUp, PgDn, F11 and F12 keys sensibly.
! Sun's keysyms for those are weird: F27, F29, F33, F35, SunF36 
! and SunF37 respectively.  Note that the F11 and F12 keysyms
! are already being used (by the keys labelled Stop and Again)
! so we rename those first.  XKeysymDB contains two keysyms SunStop
! and SunAgain, but the values are the same as for Cancel and Redo.
! (If all this leaves you hopelessly confused, don't worry:
! you're not alone.)

keysym F11 = Cancel
keysym F12 = Redo
keysym F27 = Home
keysym F29 = Prior
keysym F33 = End
keysym F35 = Next
keysym SunF36 = F11
keysym SunF37 = F12

! This is the key labelled PrSc.  There is a keysym called Sun_PrintScreen,
! but it's better to use a generic name.
keysym F22 = Print

! On a Type 4 keyboard the keys labelled - and + on the keypad are
! KP_Subtract and KP_Add respectively, but on a Type 5 keyboard
! (the one like a PC's) they are F24 and KP_Add.  So if you have
! a Type 5 keyboard you may want to uncomment the line below.
!keysym F24 = KP_Subtract
