;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `lotus-perl-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `lotus-perl/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `lotus-perl/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `lotus-perl/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

  "The list of Lisp packages required by the lotus-perl layer.

Each entry is either:

1. A symbol, which is interpreted as a package to be installed, or

2. A list of the form (PACKAGE KEYS...), where PACKAGE is the
    name of the package to be installed or loaded, and KEYS are
    any number of keyword-value-pairs.

    The following keys are accepted:

    - :excluded (t or nil): Prevent the package from being loaded
      if value is non-nil

    - :location: Specify a custom installation location.
      The following values are legal:

      - The symbol `elpa' (default) means PACKAGE will be
        installed using the Emacs package manager.

      - The symbol `local' directs Spacemacs to load the file at
        `./local/PACKAGE/PACKAGE.el'

      - A list beginning with the symbol `recipe' is a melpa
        recipe.  See: https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa#recipe-format")

  ;; Configuration in .emacs2

  ;; Editing
  ;; cperl-mode provides an excellent environment for perl
  ;; programming. With a good style, the indentation is fine. I recommend
  ;; the setting in PBP.

  ;; If you want reindent the code, using M-x indent-region when region is
  ;; selected. I recommend using pde-indent-dwim, it saves you time to
  ;; markup region.

  ;; Comment or uncomment code using M-x comment-dwim. When region
  ;; selected, if there are line uncommented, then comment the region,
  ;; otherwise uncomment the region. If no region selected and have
  ;; non-whitspace characters in current line, it will add comment at the
  ;; end of the line. If in empty line or only whitespace in current line,
  ;; it will add new comment. If there is comment already, jump to the
  ;; position where comment starts. With C-u prefix, it can delete comment
  ;; in current line. So with this command, all jobs about comment are
  ;; done.

  ;; Most editor provide feature about code-snippet. In emacs, you can use
  ;; abbrev. First you should turn on abbrev-mode. cperl-mode provides some
  ;; useful abbrevs, for example after keywords if, else, elsif, while,
  ;; for, foreach, unless and until. Also for pod items =head11, =over,
  ;; =head2, =pod.

  ;; Emacs code completion is not as gaudy as other editors, but it
  ;; provides more ways and high customization for completion. The most
  ;; useful commands for completion are hippie-expand and
  ;; dabbrev-expand. They can do almost all kinds of completion. In my
  ;; experience, I use hippie-expand to complete whole line and
  ;; dabbrev-expand to complete words. Emacs doesn't provide semantic
  ;; analysis for perl, so there is no exists way for code intelligent
  ;; completion. Although hippie-expand provide completion for file name,
  ;; its priority is too low to reach. So you may need addtional command
  ;; for file name completion when editing. I recommend use
  ;; comint-dynamic-complete.
  ;; Command
  ;;     * C-M-\ indent-region
  ;;     * C-M-= pde-indent-dwim
  ;;     * C-; comment-dwim
  ;;     * M-/ dabbrev-expand
  ;;     * M-; hippie-expand
  ;;     * C-c f comint-dynamic-complete

  ;;     * M-\ delete-horizontal-space
  ;;     * C-M-a beginning-of-defun
  ;;     * C-M-e end-of-defun
  ;;     * C-M-f forward-sexp
  ;;     * C-M-b backward-sexp
  ;;     * C-M-u backward-up-list
  ;;     * M-{ backward-paragraph

          ;; Debugger

          ;; gud of emacs supports perldb, but it is simple and crude compare with
          ;; gdb-ui. PDE provides a similar interface like gdb-ui. But it is known
          ;; not stable. You may have a try.

          ;; Perl Debugger

          ;; perl5db provides a convenient command line interface, and maybe it
          ;; more quick to use command than using emacs command. Remember perl5db
          ;; commands is worth if you want to debug perl script. Except n, s, c, b,
          ;; B, w, W, L, p, x these most used commands, these are also convenient:

          ;;     * f Switch to a loaded file
          ;;     * l Jump to line or function
          ;;     * . Back to current line
          ;;     * r Return from current subroutine
          ;;     * V Search for variable
          ;;     * S Search for function
          ;;     * y List lexcial variables

          ;; Syntax Checking and Running
          ;; cperl-mode doesn't provide command for syntax checking and running. It
          ;; did put them on menu. Activating them requires mode-compile. But I
          ;; don't like mode-compile, it makes simple problem complicated. I like
          ;; smark-compile+. But customizing and extending smart-compile+ is not
          ;; convenient, so I rewrite the library to compile-dwim. You can use
          ;; compile-dwim-compile for syntax checking and compile-dwim-run to run
          ;; the script.

          ;; If you have experience of GUI programming, a problem may raise when
          ;; running several programs at the same time. compile asks you to kill
          ;; previous process before the new one starts. If you think this is not
          ;; convenient, you can set compilation-buffer-name-function to
          ;; pde-compilation-buffer-name.

          ;; Emacs provides flymake to do on-the-fly syntax checking. in my humble
          ;; opinion, it is not very useful. But you can turn it on if you want
          ;; emacs seems more like IDE.

          ;; For perl novice, it is common forgeting chmod before running perl
          ;; script. The library executable provide a solution for automatic chmod
          ;; when saving file.
