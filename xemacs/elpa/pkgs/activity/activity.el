;; user which could further utilized to visualize activity of user
;; during period of time or editing session.

;; Enable Activity for the current buffer by invokingi
;; `activity-mode'. If you wish to activate it globally, use
;; `global-activity-mode'.

;; Set variable `activity-api-key' to your API key. Point
;; `activity-cli-path' to the absolute path of the CLI script
;; (activity-cli.py).
