;;; Code:

;; Use filecache:

;; filecache remembers visited places. Add the directory into the cache:

(message "tramp-mode %s" tramp-mode)

(eval-after-load "filecache"


  '(add-hook
    'sharad/enable-startup-inperrupting-feature-hook
    #'(lambda ()
        (condition-case e
            (file-cache-add-directory
             "/ssh:spratap@susengg-01:/")
          ('error (message "problem happened in %s fun call."
                           'file-cache-add-directory))))))

;; Whenever you want to load a file, you can enter C-x C-f C-<TAB> in
;; the minibuffer. The completion is done for the given directory.
