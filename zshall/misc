# Syncing Bookmarks with zsh
# zsh has a feature called ‘cd-able-vars’ which is similar to
# bookmarks but limited to directories on the local machine. Here’s
# some code to convert emacs’ bookmarks into code for zsh. First add
# this to your .zshrc:

setopt cd_able_vars
[[ -r ~/.zsh.bmk ]] && source ~/.zsh.bmk
# }}

# {{
if [ -r ~/.guix-profile/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh ]
then
    source ~/.guix-profile/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
fi

for  dir in ~/.guix-profile/share/zsh/{5.6.2/functions,functions,site-functions}
do
    if [ -f $dir ]
    then
        fpath=($dir $fpath)
    fi
done
# }}
