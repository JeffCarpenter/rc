# Syncing Bookmarks with zsh
# zsh has a feature called ‘cd-able-vars’ which is similar to
# bookmarks but limited to directories on the local machine. Here’s
# some code to convert emacs’ bookmarks into code for zsh. First add
# this to your .zshrc:

setopt cd_able_vars
[[ -r ~/.zsh.bmk ]] && source ~/.zsh.bmk
# }}
