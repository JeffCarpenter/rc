!  The Basics:                                                                !
!                                                                             !
!  Each entry in the .Xdefaults file is called a "resource".  Each x-client   !
!  has a number of "application resources" associated with it which control   !
!  how its default behavior.  The system application defaults for most oft-   !
!  used x-clients are traditionally kept in the system directory              !
!                                                                             !
!  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults                                                  !
!                                                                             !
!  You can cd to this directory and look around if you like.  You will see    !
!  things like Xgopher, Mosaic, XTerm, etc.  These contain the default        !
!  application resources for the associated programs.  X-window system        !
!  is infinitely customizable in that it allows each user to change the way   !
!  each x-client has been configured by your system administrator.  This is   !
!  done via the .Xdefaults file in your home directory.                       !
!                                                                             !
